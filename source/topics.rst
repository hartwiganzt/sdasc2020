Topics of Interest
==================

A more specific list of topics of interest for speakers and attendees to
consider:

* Incorporating realtime and ad-hoc data analytics into applications
  and their deployment on supercomputing and large cluster platforms
* Scientific data set creation, labeling, ingest, curation, and analysis
  with stochastic approaches
* Computational steering through machine learning models informed by domain
  science priors
* Meta-data and data metrics collection and generation for large data
  collections and output data sets of computational simulations
* Multi-precision inference methods and their use on modern hardware
  for simulation data
* Novel use of discriminative and generative machine learning
  approaches for scientific data sets including adversarial and
  reinforcement learning
* Modern HPC storage issues when dealing with integration of
  computational simulation outputs with data analytics software
* Synchronous and asynchronous learning approaches at scale  for
  methods related to deep neural network training, stochastic gradient
  descent, loss-function engineering, Bayesian optimization, and others
* Model derivation and training for scalable simulations and data sets
* Hyperparameter search and optimization for large scale training and
  inference
* Deployment of statistical models and their implementations such as
  TensorFlow, (Py)Torch, Caffe 1/2, Keras, MxNet combined with their
  integration with large scale simulations through containers
  (Kubernetes, Docker, Singularity, OpenShift), virtualizaiton,
  colocation, and other deployments
* Pretrained models' creation, use, and scaling for scientific simulations
