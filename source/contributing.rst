============

We are encouraging contributions that present original unpublished research.
Submissions (up to 12 pages) should adhere to the single-column LNCS style
(http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0).  Topics of
interest include but are not limited to the following topic areas:

* Incorporating realtime and ad-hoc data analytics into applications
  and their deployment on supercomputing and large cluster platforms
* Scientific data set creation, labeling, ingest, curation, and analysis
  with stochastic approaches
* Computational steering through machine learning models informed by domain
  science priors
* Meta-data and data metrics collection and generation for large data
  collections and output data sets of computational simulations
* Multi-precision inference methods and their use on modern hardware
  for simulation data
* Novel use of discriminative and generative machine learning
  approaches for scientific data sets including adversarial and
  reinforcement learning
* Modern HPC storage issues when dealing with integration of
  computational simulation outputs with data analytics software
* Synchronous and asynchronous learning approaches at scale  for
  methods related to deep neural network training, stochastic gradient
  descent, loss-function engineering, Bayesian optimization, and others
* Model derivation and training for scalable simulations and data sets
* Hyperparameter search and optimization for large scale training and
  inference
* Deployment of statistical models and their implementations such as
  TensorFlow, (Py)Torch, Caffe 1/2, Keras, MxNet combined with their
  integration with large scale simulations through containers
  (Kubernetes, Docker, Singularity, OpenShift), virtualizaiton,
  colocation, and other deployments
* Pretrained models' creation, use, and scaling for scientific simulations

Additional Submission Format
----------------------------

We also intent to implement a unique format for submitting workshop
contributions: given the increasing relevance of sustainable software
development and open source community process, and acknowledging many
of the contributions in 2019 promoting software solutions, we will
allow for software submissions based on community-reviewed pull requests.
Specifically, authors can submit software contributions featuring detailed
software documentation, effectiveness and performance analysis by pointing
to a community-reviewed pull request in a versioning system. We will
complement the software review with a blind review assessing the
contribution's innovation level and community benefit, and decide on both,
scientific and software quality upon the acceptance of the contribution.
This workflow was recently proposed as a modern peer-reviewing concept for
computer-based research. Both, traditional contributions and software-based
contributions can be submitted to SDASC, and accepted contributions will be
presented at the half-day workshop and included in the post-conference
proceedings.

------------------------------------
Conference Logistics and Proceedings
------------------------------------

The authors of accepted contributions will get a 30 minute time slot during the
workshop to present their work. The revised versions of accepted papers will be
published as post-conference proceedings. This year, the ISC workshop chairs
organize a joint Workshop Proceedings that will be published with Springer
similar to the ISC 2020 research papers proceedings. The workshop proceedings
will be published after the conference but we will collect preliminary versions
of the papers and make them available during the workshop to your workshop
attendees.
